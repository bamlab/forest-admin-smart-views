# forest-admin-smart-views

Forest admin is a wonderful product allowing you to create your administration in a glance. It works as a freemium and one of the features you can unlock by going to a paid account is the customization of the views using [the smart views feature](https://docs.forestadmin.com/documentation/reference-guide/views/create-and-manage-smart-views)

Forest teams provided us with a few example, but when you have to go further it is sometimes a little bit hard. Therefore I created this repository we can use to share the wonderful smart views we've created :)
